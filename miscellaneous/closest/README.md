In Closest To, you deal two cards to yourself and using the digits of the cards, try to get closest to 50

So if you dealt a King and a 5, you would have 105 (vs 510 which is farther away from 50)

AI is dealt two and does the same

you can record your score vs AI using a 20 sided + 6 sided die for you and AI to keep score
