AI for Phase card game

run the AI for each turn in the game.  the AI should run after the player has declared all attackers and actions. Ideally use a deck of cards as AI tokens (black = black creature, red = white creature), after the AI attacks and creature survives, run the 000 file to determine what creature power to phase the AI creature to (also switch to the opposite color token once it is phased)
