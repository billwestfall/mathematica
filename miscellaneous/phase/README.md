AI for Phase card game

run the AI for each turn in the game.  the AI should run after the player has declared all attackers and actions. Ideally use a deck of cards as AI tokens (black = black creature, red = white creature), after the AI attacks and creature survives, run the 000 file to determine what creature power to phase the AI creature to (also switch to the opposite color token once it is phased)


In Phase bridge, deal yourself a card from a well shuffled mix of faction cards. The AI will call the trump, then play its card. For fairness, play your card first then play AI. Trump suit wins, if no trump (or both you and AI are trump), then high card of AI named cost, attack or defense value wins. Play best of 5, player to 5 round wins first wins
