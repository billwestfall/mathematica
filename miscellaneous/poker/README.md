Implementing different variations of poker in Wolfram

Butcher Boy: start with AI deal, cards are dealt one at a time, if next card matches previous card dealt by either player, that player gets the card. If at end a player has more than five cards, they discard down to 5. If player has less than 5, they are determined to have 2 of that many missing cards (if they have two cards in hand they then make up difference with three 2s)
