AI for Sabacc and the Corellian variant

Rules via https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sabacc

Sabacc was the name of a popular card game with numerous variations, many of them including a hard-to-beat hand also called sabacc. Often played at high stakes, the goal of many versions of the game was to win the sabacc pot by collecting a hand with an absolute value closest to 23, but no higher. A typical sabacc deck comprised 76 cards (60 distributed in four suits plus 16 special cards), all of which had a specific value. However, some variants used different decks, and furthermore, in many versions of the game the value and suit of a card could change at random during play, unless the card was placed in the special interference field.
