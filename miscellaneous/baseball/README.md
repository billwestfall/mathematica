Baseball game with strat-o-matic like rules


You can keep boxscore in an interactive Wolfram terminal with a line like:

`Grid[{{Inning, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, {Mets, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}, {Reds, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}}] `

and then run this line with updated score after every half inning
