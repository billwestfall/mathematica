Piquet AI

in the first variant, you and AI both play your own deck (deal yourself 12 cards with 8 cards turned down). Discard up to 5 cards and pull that many. Score like initial part of Piquet (skip trick taking section)

the points system is:

largest number of cards in one suit + number of cards in a sequence in suit + set of 3 of rank (3 points) + set of 4 of rank (14 points)
