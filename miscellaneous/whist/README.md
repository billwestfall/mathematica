attempt at an AI for playing very simple two player whist (deal 13 , name trump, then play random card)

in this variant, the AI always leads (to balance the play)

in case of a tie (since AI plays its own deck), deal two more, the winner of that wins two tricks. if that is a tie, one more card then winner wins 3, etc

for Tarot play, Major Arcana are the trump suit (no need to name trump suit). If AI plays a Major you must also play a Major if you hold one in hand
