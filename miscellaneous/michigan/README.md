AI for Michigan card game

since it's 2 player (AI vs player), should deal out 26 cards to AI and 26 to player.  One possible implementation is to deal 26 to AI, have player deal remaining cards to themself, then have player play the AI hand as well as theirs

Use a 20 sided die or equivalent to track chips one from center and for final winner. Final winner can have a set amount of chips cashed for win (like 10)
