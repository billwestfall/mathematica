attempt at Crazy Eights AI

For best results use a 20 side die to keep track of AI hand total. If their hand reaches zero they win, if yours reaches zero before that , you win

to play, run the tester script. if it matches a card in your hand (suit or rank for regular cards, card name for Force of Will), then you get to discard a card. keep track of the AI's hand (given as the second action in the script) on a 20 sided die or equivalent
