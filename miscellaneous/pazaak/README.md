The Side Deck consisted of ten special cards chosen by the player before the match. At the start of each game, four of these cards were chosen at random for the player to keep in his hand and play at any time he desired.

The side deck also had a variety of cards, and each deck was unique to the player in that he could purchase different types of cards throughout the galaxy and choose whichever ones he preferred to keep in his hand. There were two types of such cards: Plus and Minus cards, which were blue and red, and Advanced cards, which were gold. Main Deck cards were green, or in some older cases gold.

Plus Cards were blue cards that added the written value to a player's total when played. The value of the cards ranged from 1 to 6 points.

Minus Cards were red cards that were similar to the plus cards, but instead they subtracted their value from the players total. They also ranged from 1 to 6.

Plus or Minus Cards (+/-) were essentially a combination of the two; the player could choose upon play whether he wanted to add the number or subtract it from his hand. These were the most expensive and highly valued cards. They also ranged from 1 to 6.

The +/- 1 or 2 Card was a +/- card whose value could be changed to between 1 and 2.

    Flip Cards were advanced cards that changed the sign of the written number of all the cards in a player's table. For example, if a player played a 2&4, all the 2s and 4s on the table would become -2s and -4s, while all the -2s and -4s would become 2s and 4s. These cards were only available as 2&4 and 3&6. 

The Double Card was a rare card that doubled the value of the last played card. For example, if one flipped over 2, then a 9, he could play the double card, making the 9 an 18, thus adding up to 20. A player known as Mebla Dule gave the Jedi Exile this card after being beaten on Telos IV.

The Tiebreaker Card was an extremely rare card that acted like a +/-1 card, but in the event of a tie, the player who played the tiebreaker card would win. A tiebreaker card was owned by the being on Nar Shaddaa known as the Champ until he gave it to the Exile after losing his position to the Jedi.
