1.  Guard - AI guesses my card from list, if guesses right it wins
2.  Priest - AI sees my card and I need to discard that or lose next turn
3.  Baron - AI immediately presents its card value and I have to compare to mine, high value wins
4.  Handmaid - AI is immune to my cards next turn
5.  Prince = I have to discard my card and draw new , if princess I lose
6.  King - AI gets my card and I get its card
7.  Countess - if I have this and Prince or King, I need to discard (Prince) or exchange (King)
8.  Princess - if discarded then AI loses game
