Love Letter card game rules for various manifestations (regular cards, Magic, Ascension, Spoils, Tarot, Hyborean Gates, etc)

thinking about the logic for a basic AI

If AI plays:

1.  Guard - AI guesses my card from list, if guesses right it wins
2.  Priest - AI sees my card and I need to discard that or lose next turn
3.  Baron - AI immediately presents its card value and I have to compare to mine, high value wins
4.  Handmaid - AI is immune to my cards next turn
5.  Prince = I have to discard my card and draw new , if princess I lose
6.  King - AI gets my card and I get its card
7.  Countess - if I have this and Prince or King, I need to discard (Prince) or exchange (King)
8.  Princess - if discarded then AI loses game

if G print random guess from full list
if P then I must discard or AI wins next turn
If B then AI present random card from remaining list
if H then my card has no affect on AI
if P then I have to discard and draw
if K then AI and I switch hands , AI picks random value from remaining list
if C then no effect
if P AI loses
