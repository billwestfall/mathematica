rules for one handed solitaire, Yugioh version:

1)  follow normal rules of one handed solitaire with the following changes to support Yugioh deck:
2)  elements are equivalent of suit, so a first and fourth card of same element means you win middle two cards
3)  level is equal to rank, so if you get first and fourth monsters of same level you win all four cards
4)  spells and traps treat as a match in suit, that is if first and fourth cards are a spell (or both a trap), then you win the center two cards
