Deck is Ace(low) to 5 of each suit, then 9 to K of one suit to act as a fifth "suit"

Initial hand is 5 cards, then for each card drawn you must discard (hand can only be 5 cards)

When the Angel of Grace (Joker) is drawn, the hands of both AI and player revealed, best hand per poker rules wins

Run first file to determine if AI has drawn the joker. Then when you or AI draws joker (whoever is first), play second file to show AI hand
