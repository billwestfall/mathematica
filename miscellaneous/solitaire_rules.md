Aaron's Solitaire

Rules

For this Solitaire variant you will use only one library. Your opponent will also use your deck. You and your imaginary opponent start with 20 life. Your goal is to reduce his life to 0 like a normal magic game. Use the following rules:

You go first. Play your turn as normal.
Next, take the top card off of the library and place it in your "opponent's" territory. Your opponent does not need mana to cast spells (not counting X spells, which are always zero unless there's lands that can be tapped or other mana sources in your opponents territory already). If the card makes no sense, discard it and draw again. If the card can be played on more than one card in play, use the following as a guideline, but in general try to do the best you can to damage your own position. In order of priority (if they apply):
bullet	Play it in your opponent's territory, unless it hurts your opponent or you cannot play it on your opponent.
bullet	Play it on the creature with the highest current power (use toughness to resolve ties, otherwise just toss a coin, or roll a die).
bullet	Play it on the type of land that the player has the least of.
bullet	Play it on the most recently cast spell that it can be cast on.
bullet	Play it in the way that causes most damage to you.

Your opponent will always attack with all creatures that can. It will also always block with all creatures that can (unless they were tapped to attack). This includes Jade Statue if it has the mana to use it.

Your opponent will always block by matching highest toughness (it's) to lowest power (yours).
This seemingly stupid play makes up for the fact that your opponent can cast any spell without needing any mana. You will find that this comes out pretty even with a five-color deck of commons.

Balance of Power

Object of the Game

To get four creatures out that cannot attack without being destroyed by a blocker.

Layout

There are four card slots arranged in a square, a graveyard, a mana stack, and a global area for global enchantments and global artifacts.

Initial Setup

Shuffle the deck and draw cards to fill the first slot. Continue drawing until you draw a creature card then go to the next slot and repeat. If you draw a global enchantment or a non-creature artifact then place that card in the global area. If Land is drawn, put it in the mana stack. Then continue drawing for the slot. If the card is a local enchantment, instant, or sorcery, place it in that slot and continue to draw for that slot. All cards drawn for that slot belong to the creature at the top of the slot. (Note: all cards are placed face up.) Continue until all four slots have a creature at the top. The casting cost of all creatures is zero. Other cards in the creature's slot are considered to be in the creature's spell bag. Costs for the creature's spells are paid when they are cast out of the bag.

Play

After the deal, there will be four creatures, some of which may have spells they own. There may be global enchantment or artifacts that affect the entire play environment, and there may be mana in the mana stack. Mana in the mana stack is available to any creature on its turn. Once a land is tapped for mana, it is destroyed and goes to the graveyard.

Attack

Creatures can only attack creatures in slots adjacent to them. Their spells can affect any slot. Target creatures must defend an attack if able. The creature in the upper right hand slot goes first. He can attack a neighbor, play a spell, or pass. The play moves counter-clockwise around the four slots.

Damage Resolution

If a creature takes lethal damage, then it and all of its spells, artifacts, and enchantments go to the graveyard. Then, draw from the stock for a new creature as before.

General

If any text on a magic card makes no sense to this game, it is not valid. For example, life-affecting spells make no sense and are ignored. This is an extremely fun game with the right deck.

Winning

The game ends when no creature can burn any other creature, and when no creature can attack without being destroyed by a blocker. If an isolated creature cannot be blocked or is unblockable, it counts as being in balance toward the win conditions. When these conditions are met, you have achieved a “Balance of Power.” You lose the game if the library is exhausted.

Deck Tester

For this variant you will play against an imaginary opponent. The goal of the game is to either destroy five lands or deal 20 points of damage to him.  What your opponent does on his turn is determined randomly. Use the cards below to determine what he does. For each card he draws on his turn roll once. For example if he would get to draw two cards a turn then you would roll twice.

First thing you do is determine what color the roll will be. If this roll places a permanent in play then it is of this color:

Random Color Generator (1d6)

4) Red
5) Green
6) Artifact

Deep IQ

This variant has you play a game of magic against a series of tables that require 1d10. The order of play for Deep IQ's turn is simple: roll on the current action table, figure out if attacking is good for it, and attack if it's a good idea. Then end it's turn. Be sure to keep in mind that Deep IQ plays as well as you do (i.e. you have to make some decisions for it); the rule is, if you would attack or block if you were in its position, then it would. If there's more than one choice on one of Deep IQ's rolls, make the decision as though you were in its shoes. Yeah, you can cheat if you want, but cheating to beat a die and a piece of paper is about as gratifying as kissing your sister.

The table roughly corresponds to the amount of mana Deep IQ has available. It's first roll will always be on Table 1. Every time you roll for Deep IQ, check the Advancement range. If the roll falls within the range, move Deep IQ up one table (use a token to keep track). When you cast a spell like Armageddon or Jokulhaups, Deep IQ will move back to Table 1. When you destroy one of its lands (with a spell like Stone Rain), move it back one table.

Whenever Deep IQ gets a creature token, roll again on the token chart to determine the creature's abilities. Apply the number in brackets as a modifier to the roll. (Same thing goes for the Spooky Chart.) If Deep IQ's action is something you can't do, treat the result as "Do nothing."

There will be times when there's no clear-cut rule for how you should handle something (like a Winter Orb or Stasis). Is such cases, come up with an appropriate penalty (such as -5 to all Table die rolls) which lasts until Deep IQ can get rid of your offending artifact or enchantment.

Finally, keep in mind that beating Deep IQ isn't a walk in the park. If you can win even half of your games, that's an accomplishment.

Demolition

Rules

The goal of this solitaire variant is to empty your hand and have no cards left in play. If you run out of cards, or take twenty damage, you lose. You may not use any discard spells or abilities. Your creatures may attack each other. Lands and other permanent cards can be destroyed using the appropriate spells. You may also destroy any card in play by paying its casting cost in life. Lands may be discarded from play at a rate of one per turn, at the cost of one life; additional lands may be removed at a cost of eight life points each.

Erewhon's Solitaire

Rules

For this variant you will need to construct a solitaire deck. A deck of forty cards selected at random from a larger Magic stock is acceptable; you can experiment with larger decks and constructed decks, though those might not be as great a challenge. Next you will need to create a list of eight creatures for the opposing force. These are not represented by cards, but are written down, with characteristics determined by rolls of a die.

Roll once for each of these characteristics:

bullet	Power: 1d6
bullet	Toughness: 1d6
bullet	Flying: 1 in 6
bullet	Color/Ward: 1: Black 2: Green 3: Blue 4: Red 5: White 6: Colorless/Artifact (Note: roll only once for this. The color you roll will be the color of the creature and what color it has protection from. If you roll a 6 then it is an artifact creature and has protection from artifacts.)
bullet	Regenerate: 1 in 6 (if the creature has regeneration then it may regenerate once per turn.)
Your goal of this variant is to kill as many enemy creatures as possible before running out of cards. Start the game by drawing one card at a time. Each draw is considered a turn. Like regular Magic, you may reserve up to seven cards under normal conditions before discarding.  Discards and dead cards go to a graveyard off to one side. Cards in play are placed beyond your reserve. Tapped cards remain tapped until the next draw.

You may only target your imaginary opponent with any spell or ability that does damage or causes loss of life. You may not target him with spells that cause him to sacrifice creatures.

When attacking enemies, you may use a combination of creatures and spells but you may only announce your attacks once per turn. Unlike regular Magic, there is no summoning sickness, so creatures may attack on the same turn they are cast. A creature may only attack once per turn - tap the card per normal. When attacking you may decide what creature you will be attacking. You may have multiple creatures attack the same creature at the same time. For example you may have two of your creatures attack one of the enemies creature at the same time. Damage from the enemy creature should be divided in a way to kill the largest creature that it can. This means if you have a 4/4, 2/2, and a 1/1 and the opponent has a 4/2 then he would deal all the damage to the 4/4 but if he had a 3/3 then he would deal the damage to the 2/2 and 1/1. He would not assign the damage to the 4/4 because he would not be able to kill him. Trample damage awards bonus points above an enemy's toughness. Any life derived from spells, artifacts, etc., is expressed as extra points. Any life used to power spells is deducted as a penalty.

Scoring

The game ends when all enemies are destroyed or you run out of cards. Tally points in the following manner:

bullet	Add two point for each enemy destroyed.
bullet	Add one point for every life you have above 20
bullet	Add one point for every point of damage you did to the enemy.
bullet	Subtract one point for each enemy still alive.
bullet	Subtract one point for every card in your hand.
bullet	Subtract one point for each card drawn during the game.
History

This variant was created by Tulse X. Luper.

Fortress

The objective of The Fortress is to capture the fortress by killing all of your opponent's creatures and getting lucky on die rolls.

Creating A Deck

You play with a deck consisting only of land, fifteen creatures and one artifact. It is wise to put 3/3 and 4/4 creatures in, with low costs and no abilities, because abilities are not used in this version. No cards are restricted or banned, but you may only have three copies of each creature.

Before The Game Starts

Divide the deck into two parts, creatures in one, land and artifact in the other. Shuffle the creature deck, then draw any number of cards less than eight, depending on how tough you want your opponent to be. These are your opponent's creatures. Lay them out in a separate area from your cards. Now shuffle the remaining cards together.

The Rules

You start off with twenty life. If at any time your life reaches or goes below zero, you suffer total defeat. The game is played as normal Magic: The Gathering, except for the following differences:

At the end of each turn, roll a die. If you roll a one, then you gain one life. If you roll a two, three or four, lose one life. If you roll a five or six, lose two life.

The opponent cannot attack.
You may not use any abilities that creatures have.

You may put down as many lands per turn as you like, but you take one damage for each land past the first each turn.

You lose if you have no more creatures and no more cards in your deck.

The opponent blocks as follows:
bullet	He uses the creature with the lowest power/toughness that can still kill your creature and survive.
bullet	If he cannot kill yours with any of his, he uses the creature with the lowest toughness that can survive blocking.
bullet	If he cannot survive blocking your creature with any of his, he uses the one with the lowest power that can still kill your creature.
bullet	If he cannot kill or survive yours he uses the one with the least total of power/toughness.

When There Are No More Creatures...

If you are alive until the turn after there are no more opposing creatures, then you attack the Fortress with all of your creatures. Count the total creature damage you are dealing to the fortress. Roll 3d6. Then look at the following table:

bullet	If the total creature damage is greater than 3d6+5, you have barged through the door, killed all of the occupants and settle down to live in the Fortress. This is a total Victory.
bullet	If the total creature damage is more than 3d6, you run inside and take control, but the occupants escape through a back entrance. This is a convincing victory.
bullet	If the total creature damage is equal to 3d6, you ran inside, but it was deserted. The occupants had vanished. This is a victory.
bullet	If the total creature damage is less than 3d6, you run inside and kill some of the occupants and some escape. In the process, though, you are badly wounded. This is a draw.
bullet	If the total creature damage is less than 3d6-5, then you run inside and it is deserted. Suddenly, your reinforcements arrive. Just as enemy troops enter the hall. You must choose to play again or admit total defeat.
History

This variant was created by Jack Lloyd.

Hunsberger's Solitaire

The basic scenario for this game is that you are a mage that has been entrapped on another plane, and if you do not free yourself soon, your soul will be lost for all eternity. You must fight with whatever means necessary to free yourself from this domain. In this dimension you float in a fathomless chaos devoid of substance and order, a panoply of color and thoughts surround you as you fight to gain your freedom. Mana color does not exist here, as all colors exist in one. You need only to concentrate on the color you wish and it can be tapped and put into use to secure your freedom. The task is mighty. Already you can feel your form begin to fragment, chunks of thought spin off into the One. You begin to feel its pull. Resist.

Starting the Game

The game is begun by dealing cards into what is called the Timer deck. The object of the game is to do as many points of damage as you can before the cards in the Timer deck run out. The size of the Timer deck is fifteen cards. These cards are dealt off the top of your main deck and are put in a small pile to the player's right. Main decks can be any size. Larger decks can present problems because you are less apt to draw useful cards before your Timer deck runs out.

If you feel you have too many cards in your main deck, the following variant works quite well. Shuffle well and take the first sixty cards that come into your hand and play a couple of games. Sixty seems to be a minimum for main decks as you are apt to run out of cards before you make it through your Timer deck with any less. Some interestingly high scores have been yielded this way. You don't necessarily need a bunch of "great" cards in your deck to get a high score. You just need a lot of luck and a few correct decisions.

The next step is to flip the top card of your Timer deck, placing it on top of the pile, and deal three cards from your main deck. Place these cards face up in a horizontal row next to your Timer deck. These four cards form your hand. Reserve space above your hand for what are called Save slots. These two spaces will hold cards, which can stay out when all the other cards go to the graveyard. The object of the game is to do the maximum amount of damage possible to your imprisoning enchantment in the amount of time allowed for by the Timer deck.

Turn Sequence

Flip timer card and deal three new cards from main deck.

Untap cards.

 Cast spells, summon creatures and do damage with spells, artifacts, by tapping land, or creatures *

Place new cards in save slots and discard cards they replace (except in cases of multiple lands). Save cards can have spells, enchantments, and sorceries cast on them. This does not count as another card as it is played on a card in Save slot.

Discard all the cards in your hand (except for cards in the Save slots).

* A card does not have to be in a Save slot to attack, just summoned.

Step-By-Step

Flip Timer card

You do this to start your turn. Flip the top card in your Timer deck and then deal three cards from your main deck and lay them next to the Timer deck to form your hand. If the card you flip from your Timer deck is a land you may, if you wish, move it to an Save slot immediately and flip the next card in your Timer deck without dealing a completely new hand.

Untap

All lands that were tapped during the attack phase now become untapped.

Cast spells, summon creatures and do damage with spells, artifacts, by tapping land, or creatures

This is the portion of your turn where you cast spells and summon creatures to do damage to the enchantment that has imprisoned you. To cast a spell or summon you need only have the appropriate amount of mana. All mana is colorless in this realm. This is mainly to keep the people who use one or two color decks from cleaning up with the points. Besides this game is hard enough to win already. You can attack with as many spells and creatures as you cast with available untapped mana. This will allow you to make multiple attacks using creatures in your Save slots as well as creatures in your hand.

When you summon a creature, it has no summoning sickness, unlike in the regular Magic: the Gathering rules. When all of your mana is exhausted you then survey the damage you have done. You will find that most enchantments are not usable in this game. The only enchantments you can use are ones that affect your summoned creatures. Some enchantments have special abilities that are listed in the section marked Special Rules etc. When you summon a creature you denote its state by tapping it or turning it sideways, for a creature must attack the turn it is summoned. After you attack with a creature, you discard it immediately.

Spells also function differently than the regular game of Magic: the Gathering in that if a spell has an offensive capability you can use that spell to do damage. This is done by paying your mana for the spell and doing damage equal to the amount of mana you used to cast it. If you have a spell like Stone Rain, you could spend the three mana and do three points of damage to the enchantment. These are generally sorcery spells and they have to have something on the card which says something like, "...destroy target..."

Place new cards in Save slots and discard cards they replace

You may, at this stage of your turn, place any cards you wish to save in the Save slots. They will replace the existing card that will then be placed into the graveyard. The exception is if the card is a land and you already have one land of that exact same color (yes, color matters here). You may then add this card to that stacked land. The stacks are limited to two cards. You can have two stacks of different colors in the Save slots but they cannot be mixed.

If at any time you realize that you have mistakenly put too much land in a stack you take mana burn equal to the excess by discarding the appropriate number from the Timer deck. You do not have to move cards up to the Save slots immediately upon drawing them. You can use them and then move cards into their place. For example, if you draw two plains, and have a forest and Disintegrate in your Save slots, you can tap the two plains, the forest and use the Disintegrate (doing two damage), then move the two tapped plains to the Save slot currently occupied by the now expended Disintegrate.

Discard all the cards in your hand

Discard all cards that are not in your Save slots at this point. They all go face up to the graveyard. Spells which retrieve objects and creatures from the graveyard (Reconstruction, etc.) as well as Raise Dead spells work on this plane.

Ending the Game

The game ends when you are out of Timer cards, pure and simple. You flip your last Timer card and finish out the turn and that's it. If you run out of cards in your main deck keep drawing cards from your Timer deck, trying to score points, until you have exhausted them. Tally up your score and if you have scored more than forty points of damage you have successfully escaped the mage's imprisoning enchantment. If you find that you are beating this goal regularly bump it up ten or so. This game was designed to be used with a sixty-card deck straight out of the shrink wrap so customized decks may not be suitable.

To give a standard for high scores, scores are denoted by the number of cards in the deck and the number of points as such: 60/45 (meaning sixty cards, forty five points).

Another variant for those who regularly surpass forty damage is to try and score as many points as you have cards in your main deck after dealing the Timer deck (deck size - fifteen) or try to score as many points as you have cards in your main deck.

Special Rules and Exceptions

bullet	Festival - Free discard and attack without needing to turn new Timer deck card over.
bullet	Inquisition - Look at remaining cards in the Timer deck and assign damage as normal and then discard those cards.
bullet	Disenchant - Deal two points of damage when cast because you are trying to break out of the enchantment that holds you.
bullet	Righteousness - This requires white mana specifically to cast and you are the defender (7/7). This ability can only be used once per game and if the card comes up again in the same game it is discarded.
bullet	Drain Life - Does as much damage as you have mana but you can gain no more than one extra card.
bullet	Enchantments can only be cast on your own artifacts or creatures. Any enchantment that involved a "target" other than the cards in your current hand are of no use and are discarded at the beginning of your next turn.
bullet	Some cards will not allow you to do anything and must be discarded:
bullet	Wrath of God (unless you want to destroy you own creatures)
bullet	Walls without power ratings
bullet	Lots of blue spells (as there are a lot of defensive ones) such as Psychic Venom, Erosion, etc.
bullet	This just basically means that you have a wasted spot and that much less of a chance of surviving. Cards that give you life can only be used once (even artifacts). They function by adding the appropriate amount of cards to the Timer deck.
Instant Death

If, at any time during the game, you have 8 mana producing lands out you are dead from extreme mana burn. You lose.

History

This variant was created By Jeffery Hunsberger

Mana Maze Solitaire

The object of the game is variable. As described below, you might have to destroy a particular card in play, or remove all the cards in the layout from play without running out of life points.

Mana Maze alters the following basic game concepts:

In Play

In normal Magic, a card is considered "in play" as soon as its casting is resolved. In Mana Maze, cards are stacked as in traditional solitaire, and are brought into play by being exposed. That is, if a card is in the game and is not covered by any other card, it is considered in play. Cards in play are "active" or "inactive".

Active

Active cards are all permanents that can exist independently of other cards: creatures, artifacts, land, and general enchantments (that is, any enchantment can stand alone and need not be cast on something else). An active card is considered to enter play "pre-cast" - its abilities can be used freely without paying the casting cost. Treat active cards like any cast permanent in a normal Magic game. Any activation costs must still be paid.

Passive

Passive cards include the following: sorceries, instants, and interrupts, as well as enchantments that must be cast on creatures, artifacts, land or enchantments. A passive card comes into play uncast; you still must cast it in order to use it. However, passive cards are still in play and may be targeted by spells. The casting of passive cards follows all normal Magic rules, requiring appropriate mana and an available target in play. You may be a target yourself if the spell can target players. Also, for game purposes, when an enchantment is placed on another card, both cards are still considered exposed and in play. Either card may be the target of a spell.

Out of Play

The graveyard starts the game empty. All cards that leave play, as explained below, are considered to have gone to the graveyard unless otherwise specified. You may re-cast any card returned to your "hand" if you have the appropriate mana (and a target for targeted spells), but it is out of play for game purposes until re-cast. If a card is brought back into play by recasting or by another card, place it on top of any exposed card, putting the newly covered card out of play.

Owner/Controller/Caster

Cards that use any of these terms refer to you, the player.

Opponent

Effects that target an "opponent" have no effect in Mana Maze.

Life Points

In Mana Maze you start with only one life point. If at any time your life point total falls to zero or below you die instantly and lose the game.

Mana Burn

The final step before the game ends is clearing the mana pool. If you have any mana remaining in your mana pool, you suffer one point of mana burn for every leftover point of mana. If mana burn reduces you to zero life points, you lose the game.

Getting Rid of Cards In Play

In Mana Maze, cards can be removed in five different ways:

Tapping A Card

Whenever a card is tapped, it is destroyed and sent to the graveyard. Any effect from tapping occurs before the card is removed from play.

Casting A Spell

If a spell is cast (with a proper target and a paid cost), it is removed from play and put into the graveyard unless otherwise specified. The effect of the spell occurs before the card leaves play.

Destroying A Card

The destruction of a card removes it from play and puts it in the graveyard unless otherwise specified.

Killing A Creature

If a creature is destroyed by any means normally available in Magic, it is removed from play and sent to the graveyard unless otherwise specified.

Sacrificing A Card

Whenever a card is sacrificed, it goes to the graveyard unless the card says otherwise. Any effect from the sacrifice occurs before the card is removed from play.

Getting Started

Now it's time to start a game. First, build a Mana Maze solitaire deck, then decide what kind of Mana Maze game to play, as follows:

Layout

As in traditional solitaire, the cards are laid out in a pattern. With sixty cards, there are several layouts to choose from.

bullet
Six piles (ten cards each), no hand
bullet
Seven piles (seven cards each), eleven-card hand
bullet
Eight piles (six cards each), twelve-card hand
bullet
Eight piles (half seven cards, half eight cards), no hand
bullet
Nine piles (five cards each), fifteen-card hand
bullet
Nine piles (all with seven cards except three piles with six cards), no hand
bullet
Ten piles (six cards each), no hand
bullet
Pyramid style (with base of eight exposed cards), twenty-four-card hand
When a layout includes a "hand", that simply means that you have extra cards left over to thumb through, one or three cards at a time, to break logjams. This Mana Maze "hand" is not to be confused with the Magic "hand" that a card goes to if unsummoned.

Open Or Closed

In an open game, all cards are laid out face-up at the start. The open game is less prone to luck and therefore requires more thought. In a closed game, only the top card of each pile is visible. This takes a lot of pressure off, because you don't have to take all the extra data into account.

Goal

Many goals are possible. The following are just a few potential goals.

Destroying A Particular Card

This is the simplest goal. Put one or more cards in your deck and then find and remove them. The more targets you have, the harder the game will be. If you use multiple targets, it's fun to pick cards that fit a particular theme.

Destroy All The Cards

Simply put, win by destroying everything. This is the hardest variation, as it requires the careful matching of all your resources so as not to strand yourself with a card that you have no way to get rid of. You should play this variation open-handed, because you will need all the information you can get.

Get To A Particular Life Total

This variation requires that you pepper the deck with lots of cards that give and take life. The goal is to get to the life-givers and reach a certain life total.

Any goal is fine, as long as it requires you to work through the cards to accomplish it. You can define any objective, such as getting seven blue cards in your hand, but remember to build your deck to make such a goal possible.

Building a Mana Maze Solitaire Deck

When creating a deck, here are some factors to think about:

Colors

As you begin playing Mana Maze, try using all five colors. A five-color deck is the easiest type of deck to build and the most varied in play.

Mana

The mana mix is roughly the same as in a normal game (30% to 40%). The balance for each color should be determined by how many passive cards and cards with colored activation costs you have in each color. If you find yourself always short or flush with mana, change the mix accordingly.

Creatures

Creatures are an important part of Mana Maze and will typically make up at least a quarter of your deck. Remember to add a significant number of creatures with special abilities, as they tend to make the game more fun.

Artifacts

These add some spice to the game but are not needed in quantity.

General Enchantments

These don't tap and aren't cast, so they are the hardest cards to get rid of. Use enchantments that have an impact, and keep them down to a handful.

Passive Cards

Active cards (permanents) tend to be the obstacles in the puzzle, and passive cards provide most of the house-cleaning needed. This means that your passive cards should be close in number to your active cards. Also, try to include a lot of other passive cards that destroy a lot of other types of cards, because these provide the nuts and bolts of Mana Maze.

Healing/Damaging Cards

These cards can be left out entirely, but if you do use them, try to balance the deck with an equal number of healing and damaging cards.

Other Tips

Make sure every card can be destroyed by at least two other cards in the deck. Also, throw in three or four spells that provide mana in some way.

When creating your first deck, here is a good checklist to follow:

bullet
Four of each type of basic land (twenty cards).
bullet
Three creatures from each color. One creature should have a toughness of three or greater, and the other two should have a toughness of one or two. Make sure at least one of these creatures has a special ability (fifteen cards).
bullet
Four spells of each color. Make sure at least two of each color can be used to destroy another type of card (twenty cards).
bullet
Five artifacts. Make at least two of them creatures, and throw in at least one artifact that provides mana (five cards).
One Final Word

If you're winning too easily, throw a few curves into your game: add some big creatures to your deck, play a closed hand, or make the goal destroying all the cards. If you're getting frustrated, check your deck. It is possible to create an unwinnable game.

History

This variant was created By Mark Rosewater.

Mountain Magic

Introduction

The war has been long and bloody. Both you and your enemy have suffered hard and heavy losses through your countless assaults and counterstrikes. Your resources are dwindling fast, and at times it seemed that you were about to lose control of it all. Fortunately, your enemy is in the same position. You stand in the middle of an uneasy, precarious balance, a balance that could shift in either direction with no warning at all.

After what seemed to be eons of studying and incantations that nearly drained you of all your strength, you have located a place of immense power, power that could be used to banish your enemy from the face of the world forever. You ready the remainder of your troops to set for this place where victory will be yours.

Shortly thereafter you catch a spy. Too late, the ogre had already informed your enemy of your plans and is also preparing his assault on the place of power. You are in need of utmost haste. Your enemy's last reported position of Ghazban is days closer than your current holdout in the Kerr Ridges.

When you arrive at the foot of the mountain, you realize that your fears were not unfounded. Already the face of the mountain is dotted with countless campfires. Your advanced scouts report many sentry patrols. Your enemy is nearing the place of power near the mountain's summit.

Next morning at the break of day, you start your assault. This is unlikely to be the final battle, but it is probably the most important.

Object

To climb the Magic Mountain, bringing up enough forces to destroy the forces occupying it.

Setup

First you need to create a solitaire deck. This deck should compose of sixty-five cards with the following distribution (you can substitute an artifact for any non-land card, to a maximum of four artifacts):

bullet	Twenty lands, four of each color. Any multi-lands can be substituted for any land that generates either mana produced by the multi-land.
bullet	Fifteen creatures, three from each color.
bullet	Ten sorceries, two from each color.
bullet	Ten enchantments, two from each color.
bullet	Ten fast effects (interrupts and instants) of your choosing.
Separate the land cards from the rest of the deck. Shuffle the land deck and the spell deck separately. Clear a rather large section of your table. Place the land deck on one side of the table and the spell deck on the other side. Turn over the first seven cards from your spell deck and place them in a row at the foot of the table. This represents your initial forces. From an unused deck of cards, choose five cards at random and place them face down without looking at them at the head of the table. These represent the forces occupying the mountain. These cards should be non-land cards.

The Play

Start by flipping over the top card in your spell deck. If you are able to, you can place this card on the next row, touching two cards in the row below it. If you are unable to play the card immediately, you must place it face up in your discard pile. You can place a card from the spell deck on two adjacent cards in a row if any of the following apply:

bullet	The new card has at least one thing in common with each of the cards below it.
bullet	The new card will complete a "set" with the two cards below it. A set includes: three types of spells (enchantment, sorcery and fast effect spells), or placing a card on two of its color's natural enemies.
Continuing Play

If, after placing any card on your mountain, you are able to legally place the first face up card in your graveyard on your mountain, you may do so. If you are unable to move any cards from your graveyard to the mountain, draw another card and continue. Artifacts are wild cards. That is, they may be placed on any set of cards and any card may be placed on an artifact if it has something in common with the other card upon which it is placed.

If you draw the last card from you spell deck and cannot legally place it or complete the mountain, you have failed to climb the mountain and lose immediately.

When the Mountain is Complete

When the mountain is complete, trace a path from the top card to the bottom of the mountain. These cards represent the forces you will use to overthrow the occupying forces. The path is chosen as such: starting with the top card, choose one of the cards it is touching in the row below it. Repeat with the chosen card until you choose a card in the bottom row.

After having chosen your forces, turn over the five cards representing the occupying forces and do battle. You may want to remove the chosen cards from the mountain at this point.

Battle

Both you and your "opponent" draw from your mana deck. You and your enemy use mana to power your cards. A card is considered powered when it has received enough mana to satisfy its colored mana requirement. Artifacts cannot be powered. They are under a damping field.

Draw a card from the mana deck. If any of your cards are able to use that colored mana place it on the card. If the card is powered, you may use it. Otherwise, draw a card for your opponent. If your opponent can use this mana, it shall be used. If any choice is involved, follow this order:

bullet	Counterspells, power sinks, spell blasts, etc.
bullet	Damage dealing spells
bullet	Creatures
You are allowed to place only one land card per turn. You and your opponent continue to take turns drawing cards until the mana deck is empty or one of the forces is eliminated. After a card is used, it becomes unpowered and must be powered again before it is reused.

Creature Battle

Powered creatures can attack any one creature of the opposing forces. If more than one creature is powered, they may attack the same creature. Compare power vs. toughness and remove any dead creatures from play. The opposing forces will always assign damage to kill the greatest number of creatures. Powered creatures of the opponents will attack the creature with the highest power, providing it can survive the attack.

Only flyers can launch an attack against a powered flyer. If a landwalker is powered, it can only be attacked by another landwalker of the same type. If a powered creature has a special ability, it may be used. Special abilities which have an activation cost must be powered separately at the cost written on the card. These abilities can be "stacked" or saved up by paying for more than one use. If part of the cost to use the special ability requires that the card become tapped, the creature will become unpowered.

Spell Battle

Powered damage dealing spells with an X as the casting cost will have X large enough to do exactly the amount needed to kill the creature it is targeting. Spells of this nature powered by the opponent will be targeted at your creature with the highest power. Powered counterspell effects can be targeted at sorceries, instants and interrupts, whether powered or not. They cannot be targeted at creatures; they have been summoned long ago. If a spell is counterspelled, it is removed from play. Counterspells by your opponent will first target your counterspells, then your damage dealing spells. Counterspells with an X as part of the casting cost will have X large enough to be exactly the amount needed to counter the target spell. X-spells that do not cause damage or counter spells will have an X equal to three.

Special Rules

Effects that cause a powered card to become tapped unpower it. Effects that cause an unpowered card to become tapped remove the target card from the game. Effects that cause an unpowered card to become untapped power it. Powered cards cannot benefit from "untapping".

If you are forced to pick up extra cards, take them from the land deck. Remember that you are allowed to place only one land per turn. The extras must be discarded immediately. If you are forced to discard, discard from the top of the land deck. This includes the card that would normally have been drawn by the wizard targeted by the effect. These cards are out of play for the remainder of the game.

If an effect calls for the destruction of a land, destroy the next land card to be drawn by the wizard targeted by the effect.

Upkeep costs for creatures must be paid immediately upon powering of the creature. Upkeep costs must only be paid once for each power up. If the cost cannot be paid upon power up, then the creature will refuse to serve you and walk from the battlefield. Unpowered creatures do not require upkeep payment.

Effects that cause the emptying of a mana pool will cause all cards of the target wizard to become unpowered. Cards that would normally have been drawn from your library due to some effect must be drawn from the cards remaining in your mountain.

End of Game

The game can end in any of the following ways:

bullet	Your forces destroy all cards in the enemy's territory. You find him and say "NI" until he goes mad and jumps off of a cliff. This is a total victory.
bullet	You draw your last mana card and your opponent has spells in play, but no creatures. All spells fizzle. Your remaining creatures can take over the mountain. This is a victory.
bullet	You draw your last mana card and neither you nor your opponent has any creatures in play. All spells fizzle. You have fought for naught. This is a draw.
bullet	Your draw your last mana card and both your and your opponent have creatures in play. All spells fizzle. A passing Shivan Dragon sees your exhausted troops and decides to have lunch. This is a draw.
bullet	You draw your last mana card and you have no creatures in play. Your opponent's remaining creatures have a firm hold on the mountain. Try again tomorrow. This is a defeat.
bullet	Your enemy destroys all your cards. He then finds you hiding under a shrubbery, whimpering and calling for your mommy. He forces you to watch reruns of the Smurfs dubbed in Icelandic with Russian subtitles. This is an absolute, total, humiliating defeat. Have a nice day.

Solitaire

Ever wanted to challenge yourself to a Magic Duel? Here’s how! All you need is a deck (either a deck you use all the time or a sealed deck), the rules below, and a slightly different way of approaching the game. Solitaire Magic won’t improve your timing skills or the menacing glare that intimidates opponents. It will, however, improve your card memory skills, including your ability to estimate how likely you are to draw a card based on how many cards you’ve seen.

Setting up the Table

Take your deck, shuffle, and deal out seven traditional solitaire stacks – the first has one card, the second two, and so on. As long as a stack contains any cards, the top one is always turned face up. The remaining cards are you deck. You start with no hand and an empty graveyard. There are no life totals, so don’t worry about that. The goal of the game is to eliminate all the cards in these seven stacks before cycling through your deck three times.

Lands must be moved up above the stacks, where the aces would go in standard solitaire. Each different land type is placed in its own pile. If more than one copy of a card is ever face up or in your hand, move it to a stack with that card on top. In other words, if two stacks both have Hurloon Minotaurs on top, you must move one Minotaur on top of the other one.

The Seven Stack (And How to Get Rid of Them)

The cards on top of each stack have many uses. If the card is a permanent, it’s considered in play, unless it’s a local enchantment. If there’s more than one card face up on a stack (which cold happen if you’ve drawn multiple copies of a card), all those cards are in play. For the purposes of card text, you don’t control any of these cards. However, you may play these cards by paying their cost as described below.

A card on top of a stack may be targeted as if it were in play, in a player’s hand, or even as if it were being cast. For example, AEther Flash is on top of a stack, and you’d like to get rid of it. You could play Disenchant, Power Sink, or Duress – from your hand or from another stack. Because those cards could target AEther Flash either in play, while being cast, or in hand, you could use any of them to remove it from the stack.

Creatures on the stacks can also be destroyed in combat. In Solitaire Magic, attacks are declared against stack, not a player. The Magic creature-combat rules apply. Your creature is considered to be attacking, and all the creatures in the pile are considered to be blocking. Since there are no turns, creatures do not suffer from summoning sickness. Remember, this will usually just be one creature – unless you’re facing a stack of identical creatures like the Hurloon Minotaurs above.

Sacrifice Your Lands

Instead of playing lands and tapping then for mana, you sacrifice lands to generate mana (and the sacrificed lands go from the top row to the graveyard). In order to play a card or ability, you must sacrifice a land that produces at least one colored mana of the card you’re playing. All other costs are ignored. If a source provides more then one mana, the extra is lost. For instance, sacrificing a swamp to play Dark Ritual will only allow you to play one spell or ability requiring at least B. if a spell or ability has X in its cost, X is 1, plus 1 for each additional land you sacrifice or mana source you play.

Three Trips through the Library

As in normal Magic, you draw cards from your library. But in Solitaire, you draw three at a time and look only at the top one. Also, you don’t lose the first time you’ve drawn all your cards. Instead, you can go through the deck three before you lose. Place the cards you’ve gone through into a discard pile. When your library is empty, the discard pile becomes the library (unless you’ve gone through the library three times already). Library-searching effects can still be played. Harrow, for example, would allow you to search your library for two basic lands and put them into play. In this case, the lands would go directly into the appropriate land stacks above the seven stacks.

One Permanent at a Time

You can never control more than one permanent, except for local enchantments. Play that permanent below your seven stacks. Whenever you use a permanent’s ability – or attack with it if it’s a creature – you sacrifice it when the action is completed. You may use abilities that play as fast effects multiple times before sacrificing the permanent, such as Knight of Dusk’s “BB: Destroy target creature blocking Knight of Dusk.” You can play a local enchantment on that permanent (or several enchantments), and any enchantments get sacrificed when the creature does.

Your Hand – A Precious Resource

Of the three cards you draw at one time, only the top card is revealed, and that card is considered your hand. If your hand matches a card on top of a stack, it must be moved to that stack.

If you have to discard your hand (if you play Apocalypse, for example), place the top card from your hand in the discard pile. If an effect directs you to draw, take the top card from your library and make it the top card of your hand. Effects that return cards to your hand put those cards on top of your hand in any order you chose. Capsize, for instance, can move a permanent from the top of a pile to the top of your hand. Evacuation, likewise, would put all face-up creatures – plus your permanent if it’s a creature – on top of your hand in any order you choose.

Aim for the Graveyard

This works the same as the Magic graveyard. Al destroyed cards are placed in the graveyard, including lands sacrificed to pay for spells and abilities. Remember, your goal is to eliminate the seven stacks, so you want to put a lot of cards in the graveyard.

The Rest of the Rules

Because there are no turns, anything that happens at the beginning or end of any phase is ignored. Abilities that are played during a phase can be used at any time. As always, one you use an ability, the permanent is sacrificed. Since there are no life totals, damage is of no consequence to you, though it still gets rid of creatures. If an ability requires you to pay life, you must discard a card from your library for each life you wish to pay.

Some Helpful Hints

bullet	 Try and clear stacks away early. If there are two copies of the same cards on top of a stack, move the one on the shorter stack to the other copy. This will help you eliminate a stack and reduce the chance of a card in your hand matching a card on the stack.
bullet	Avoid using cards from your hand. The more cards you use from your hand, the less mana you’ll have available to play the cards you’re trying to eliminate. Remember that you can play face-up cards as if they were in your hand.
bullet	Before drawing cards, try to eliminate as many cards as possible using the resources already on the table. Remember, only three trips through the library!
bullet	Be careful when playing a permanent. You need to have a way to get rid of it, unless you want to control it and nothing else for the remainder of the game.
bullet	Not sure about how a card works in Solitaire? Make your own ruling – it’s Solitaire, after all. Who’s going to argue with you?
History

This variant was taken from Duelist Issue 34. It was written by Michael Mikaelian.



Wipe Out

For this solitaire variant you have seven turns in which to do yourself twenty points of damage. You may not count mana burn, Channel, Lich, or other "throw-away-life" effects towards this total. You may, however, attack yourself with creatures, and use spells, artifacts and enchantments originally intended for use against your opponent.
